This file might contain some errors as I have abandoned it years ago. A lot of people have made similar tools, so there might be better versions out there. I decided to make it public, since this info is out in the open for a while now. Feel free to use it as you please. Referencing my name or this repo is appreciated, but not mandatory. (Everyone is allowed to copy and paste!) Happy coding!
