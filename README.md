# Whitespace Steganography Encoder/Decoder

## 📖 Overview

This tool demonstrates **basic steganographic techniques** using **Unicode whitespace characters** to encode and decode hidden binary messages within plain text.

The project offers flexibility by allowing users to choose different types of whitespace characters for encoding, enhancing the subtlety of hidden messages.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encode arbitrary text into whitespace characters within normal-looking text.
- Decode hidden messages from encoded text files.
- Flexible selection of Unicode whitespace types (e.g., regular space, non-breaking space, zero-width space, narrow no-break space).
- Designed with **robust error handling** and **user input validation**.
- Educational design — clean, transparent, and responsibly documented.
